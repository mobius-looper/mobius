 In my VST effect plugin, I'd like to know when a sample in
   processReplacing
   is the first sample of a measure (or the first sample of n
   following beats,
   where n is usually 4). Since processReplacing is being called even
   when my
   sequencer (Fruityloops, at the moment) isn't even playing, or
   since the
   sequencer could jump into the middle of a song anywhere, counting
   the number
   of samples passed into processReplacing doesn't seem to help. i'm
   not sure
   if samplePos in VstTimeInfo is going to help either; it seems to
   drift in
   and out of sync with a running sum of all the "num samples" passed
   into
   processReplacing.

   Basically, what I'm trying to mimic is a phrase sampler that
   automatically
   snaps/quantizes the sample to a certain number of beats, beginning
   exactly
   on a beat. What's the most appropriate timing info to use for
   this? Is it
   even possible to do this? (Does ppqPos/cycleStartPos/cycleEndPos have
   anything to do with it?)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem: Playing flag is not moved when song position changed

I've been tackling a similar problem. One way that seems to work for
Ableton Live and VST 5 is to watch for a change in samplePos in the
beginning of process. When you see a change playback has begun. One
host I am developing for (Ableton Live) doesn't seem to set the
timeInfo playing flag. I haven't noticed the samplePos drifting as you
described but the reported samplePos when process is called first time
*does* vary.  By calculating the number of samples in a bar using the
time signature and sample rate I've been to be able to synchronise to
the bar with sample accuracy.  Pauses and changes in song position are
reflected accurately in Live and Cubase.

ppqPos - barStartPos = "ppqPos relative to the start of the current bar".

is that quick? :)

Sorry no code (I'd have to disentangle it from everything else)
but here's my method:

At the start of each process(), check if anything has changed
(tempo, time sig, song position, transport running/stopped).

If the transport has just started, or the song position has
changed (and the transport is running) or the time signature
has changed, read timeInfo->barStartPos and use this as the
reference point for working out where in a bar you are.
Cubase VST used to return wrong barStartPos values but I've
stopped caring about work-arounds for that.

Now you know the current song position in beats (ppqPos), the
number of beats in a bar, and a reference point that is the
start of a bar some time in the past. From that you can work
out the position in the current bar in beats, then convert to
samples.

For each frame in process(), add beats_per_frame to ppqPos, so
then at the start of the next process() you know if the song
position is what you were expecting it to be.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Detecting Play
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, well it isn't life threatening but this bug in Cubase SX2 has been
brought up on by SKoT McDonald on 11/24/2003 and was ignored! I also made a
post a few days ago thinking it was the ppqPos but after digging deeper it
has to do with the kVstTransport flags.

Here is the problem as I see it:

The kVstTransportPlaying flag is set a few process() calls late when playing
is activated. What it means is if the transport is at 0 and you hit play,
it rewinds a little bit (to be negative) and starts playing but without
setting the kVstTransportPlaying to true. kVstTransportPlaying only gets
set to true after a few process calls after ppqPos becomes greater than
zero. So, plugins like mine that sync to the host and only lock in at the
beginning of a bar actually miss the first bar being played. Also
kVstTransportChanged is also set to true at the same time as
kVstTransportPlaying (which is late!).

Steinberg, please acknowledge this issue!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample/Beat Conversion
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The clock you get with getTimeInfo is high resolution, but it only tells
you the clock time at the start of process. To get a clock time within
process you have to count how many samples from the start you are (as
the timeInfo clock is locked to the sample rate).

All you have to do is take the ppqPos from timeInfo at the start of
process, and increment it as you process each sample. For example, if
the tempo is 120 and the sample rate is 44100, each sample frame should
increment the clock position by 120.0 / (60.0 * sampleRate) which is
.000045 beats - high enough resolution for you?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Detecting Play
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have found a solution using the sample pos field. I still don't know why
the kVstTransportPlaying didn't work though. This solution also reset the
phase upon any non linear jump in song position.

    double samplePos = time_info->samplePos;
    bool playing = samplePos != m_samplePos;
    if (playing && !m_playing)
    {
      gate();
    }
    m_playing = playing;
    m_samplePos = samplePos;

    My apologies, but I find this naming VERY confusing. Just call these
    quarter notes. Calling them "ppq" means, to me, that the resolution
    of "1" means 1 _pulse_, so the value for one quarter note would be
    720 or so.


the number doesn't matter, 1.0 or 720 or 480 or whatever.
the term 'pulses per quarter' just means 'subunits within one quarter note'.
the advantage of normalizing ppq to 1.0 is that it can be scaled to any
other subdivision whatsoever.

what is important is that VstTimeInfo holds 2 values, the ppq position
related to the first sample within the current audio block, *plus* the
bar start position. the latter helps to display bars+beats even if
you have time signature changes within the project for instance.

    Hmm... what if your tempo is, say, 5/8? Would "1." mean 1/8th note,
    or "1." still mean 1/4 note? If it means 1/8th, you STILL need some
    other external reference to Do The Right Thing (tm).


it is called ppq pulses per *quarter*. at 1.0 ppq, a ppq is just a quarter...
so 1/8 is 0.5 ppq and one 5/8 bar is simply 2.5 ppq. 3/8 into bar 3
(counting from 1) gives 9.0 where the bar starts at 7.5 and so on.
you could just as well have defined one 4/4 bar to 'be' 1.0, but that causes
you headaches with measures other than 4/4, and ppq is an (old?) common
term in music sequencing...
charlie

----------------------------------------------------------------------

    From my understanding the ppq "units" in VSTTIMEINFO is a "normalized"
    representation of what ever the host PPQ resolution is. It is the same as
    using normalized floats to indicate a sample value.

    If the host uses 480 ppq internally, then 1.0 normalized ppq is equivalent
    to 480 pulses to the host, but the plug doesn't even care about this aspect.
    If the plugin works internally at 96 or 720 ppq, then it can convert the
    normalize ppq in vsttimeinfo into what ever it wants and be assured of its
    internal accuracy when converting from ppq to sample pos or visa-versa. The
    tempo and time sig information is provided by the host, so all of these
    calculation can be made.


exactly.

    What is not clear is how the plugin can determine when time sig changes and
    such can occur with in a sample frame.


it can't, currently.

    Is the host expected to break up
    discontinuous timesig/tempo/cycle boundaries into chunks that are less than
    the sample frame/block size?


that would be one possibility, but it sounds like even more performance
constraints.

    What I really want to know is what the barStartPos is really suppose to be.
    Nuendo is giving some very strange numbers and Cubase/CubaseSX give
    different numbers.


we already noted that nuendo and cubase sx have a bug (cubase5 should be
fine). we'll fix it asap.
the bar start pos gives you the ability to for instance display the
bar/beat position even without knowing the time signature track
(all time signature changes throughout the project) because you
know a) the current position, b) the bar counter, c) where that bar
starts, and d) the current time signature.

    How about an example or two of how barStartPos is to be calculated
    officially by the host? Define the absolute expected behavior with a few
    simple meter (and complex meter) examples.


but the 5/8 example (below) was supposed to do exactly that?

    Also, a clear explanation of samplesToNextClock would be helpful. Again,
    what have you actually defined a host's value for this member to be under
    the different boundary conditions you allude to in the SDK. It is mentioned
    that it could be negative if it addresses the "previous MIDI clock" , but
    the SDK says "next MIDI clock" as does the name of the structure member. So
    when does it indicate previous and when does it indicate next?


'next' was supposed to mean 'nearest in time' which can be prior or next
to the current position. while i admit that the term may be misleading,
it doesn't matter because you can tell from the sign if it's prior or
after the current position.

thanks for explaining the ppq thing again...

        indeed. it always requires at least two pieces of information to know
        when a given note should begin:

               beats per minute
               note value that represents 1 beat

        a lot of typical western classical and pop music has a quarter note
        representing one beat, but there is a lot of jazz with eighth notes
        representing one beat, and much music from other parts of the world
        where the idea of a note value doesn't really much sense at all
        (hence, its arbitrary which western note value to use; a quarter is

    > usually used).


        to know how long it should last, you need to know the note value.

        to know where the bar boundaries are requires another piece of
        information:

               beats per bar

        MIDI sequencers have complicated this by adding the idea of "maximal
        subdivision of a quarter note" ("ppq"), which is orthogonal to any of
        the above information. it represents a new time unit which may have a
        non-linear mapping to the passage of musical or clock time (due to
        meter changes, etc.)

        i prefer not to deal with ppq in any way other than as a limit on how
        small i can subdivide a quarter note. measuring time in bars and beats
        works fine for actual musicians ... from charlie's description, this
        sounds to me like the goal of the VST time info. counting anything in
        ppq units also means that the numbers are different if the resolution
        of the MIDI timer changes.

True, but there would be less confusion if it was just called
"quarternotes", which is what it is.

As vstTimeInfo can't tell you if anything changes *within* blocks,
I guess you have to assume the host will split blocks so they don't
contain tempo or timesig changes, *or* the host doesn't care if you
get slightly out of sync for part of a block and expects you to
re-sync at the start of the next block. (you have to do this anyway,
as Cubase and Cubasis (I haven't looked for this behaviour in other
hosts) sometimes have small jumps in position, particularly when
starting playback. I imagine it's even worse when they are following
external sync, but it still happens during offline mixdown!)

>
>But it really isn't "quarter notes" but a normalized ppq. Calling it
>normalized ppq would clarify the context.

ppq is a ratio, not a unit of time, so as previously observed it makes
no sense to measure temporal distance in ppq.

it should be measured, if anything, in pulses (also called "ticks" in
some systems). however, charlie stated that ppq is set to be 1.0
pulse-per-quarter-note, which means that any unit given in "ppq"
really *is* a measurement in quarter notes (and pulses too, by obvious
extension).

if you want to be precise "normalized pulses, where 1 pulse = 1
quarter note" would do. but as i asked earlier, why use this
nomenclature and unit when just plain only fractional quarter notes
would serve an identical purpose? what does it convey that quarter
notes do not?

there is an additional problem with using ppq in this way. the actual
MIDI temporal resolution is a function of the frequency of the timing
source used for MIDI data delivery and timestamping. by normalizing
ppq to be 1.0, and then using fractional values, nobody can discover
the real temporal resolution. unless its very large, there will always
be the occasional situation where you want to know this in order to
figure out the best way to accomplish something. if you know that
ppq=720, there are compromises you can make. if all you know is that
ppq is a real, low-value number, you can't do this.

or does the host publish the ppq ratio in some other way?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
> or does the host publish the ppq ratio in some other way?

I don't undestand why you need to know the host internal PPQ.

You can work at as high of a resolution as is possible given the current
sample rate and sample pos. The actual host PPQ is irrelevent.

How would the host PPQ being 480 vs 720 change the way you do calculations
in the plugin?

Perhaps an example of not knowing what PPQ is and how it can effect this
temporal resolution. Perhaps a definition of "temporal resolution" would
help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
>How would the host PPQ being 480 vs 720 change the way you do calculations
>in the plugin?

suppose i want to schedule MIDI output at two very closely spaced
points in time. suppose that with 1440 ppq, the two events occur on
different pulses, but with 480 they do not (basically rounding
error). think of it this way:

ppq = 480
beat note value = quarter
tempo = 120 bpm
1 pulse = beat_duration / ppq = 0.5 / 480 = 0.001 secs

now change ppq to 1440, 1 pulse = 0.00035 secs.

if i am going to schedule something at a given musical time of 3
pulses past the start of bar, the 480 ppq system can only provide
about 1msec of temporal resolution, so if the events are more closely
spaced than that, they will necessarily end up occuring on the same
"pulse". by contrast, with ppq = 1440 they will end up on different
ones.

now, in some situations, this won't matter - you just want the host to
do the best it can. but in other situations, it may matter than the
two MIDI data are delivered at the same time rather than at two
different times as intended. you might choose to delay the scheduled
time for the second data so that its delivery time (in pulses) is
different from the first.

and yes, i know what the resolution of the MIDI data rate is. imagine,
if you insist, that i'm using two independent hardware ports and two
cables. more to the point ppq is not restricted to MIDI, and if i'm
using MIDI-over-IP or SKINI or some other related protocol, the data
rate is not a limitation.

the alternative is to schedule everything using audio frames, but
there are several reasons why this is not always desirable.

>Perhaps an example of not knowing what PPQ is and how it can effect this
>temporal resolution. Perhaps a definition of "temporal resolution" would

my interpretation of ppq is that it defines the smallest possible
subdivision of a quarter note.

Overhead of getTimeInfo
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thats one idea i never understood from the spec.
    Why does everyone feel it take so much overhead each time a plugin calls
    getTimeInfo(flags)?

<snip>

David,

it has been mentioned several times here and also (as an exception 8-) in the docs that retrieving VstTimeInfo can be very costy on cpu. I do neither know why this is nor do I know if that is still valid nor if it affects only certain fields.

However, in Logic 4.8.1 / MacOS 9, PPC7400 450MHz, I measured roundabout 0.5% less cpu consumption on a single plugin instance by retrieving VstTimeInfo (ppq and bpm) only every 10th process() at a block size of 512 samples. This somewhat "convinced" me.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Is kVst TransportChanged supposed to be included in the timeinfo flags when
    the tempo has changed or not ?

    Frederic


no, not tempo. only transport state flags (mainly start/stop transition,
and cycle changed).
charlie

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 I have tried getting in touch with Steinberg on this, but no answer so far. It is in regards to CubaseSX under OSX.

Thanks to some good advice here, I recently fixed a problem we that had, relying on getTimeInfo and the samplePos value returned (as a member of the VstTimeInfo structure). We now check whether the transport state has changed instead of checking if the time (samplePos) has changed, which works fine.

However, we also use samplePos to keep track of where in time the data we are tracking occurred, in order to place all tracked data at the correct time for later pitch detection and correction. Unfortunately, it appears that samplePos is not reliable.

We can handle the case where the host simply does not support that feature, but how can we handle the fact that the value returned is simply unreliable? What we see is this: while the sampleFrames value is always coming to us as 256, the samplePos advances incorrectly. On one call to processReplacing, it does not advance at all. On the next call, it advances by 512 (twice the sampleFrames value). This causes our internal "clock" to overwrite data at one point in time, then skip ahead and process data at a later time, instead of recording the data as one continuous series. Obviously, we can hardly detect the pitch in those "missing" segments of time.

I have a workaround, for the moment, that *seems* to handle the problem, PROVIDED that the samplePos either behaves correctly or else behaves as I have described. What I do is, IF the new samplePos equals the previous samplePos, THEN I set our internal "clock" to be the sum of the previous samplePos plus the previous sampleFrames (which is what the new samplePos *should* have been). If the new value is not the same as the previous one, then I simply use that new value. So far it seems to work, but I'm not sure if this is a valid solution in all cases.

Anyone else use the samplePos value returned from calls to getTimeInfo in CubaseSX / OSX? Do you see the same behavior I have described? Does my workaround sound valid?

Thanks for any advice...

    Is there a method for determining the exact sample position that is currently
    playing out of the speakers? I'm aware of getTimeInfo, but from what I gather, it
    provides the samplePos relative to the last buffer slice, and not the samplePos that
    the ASIO driver is currently outputting. Is this right?


yes. in fact you will usually get a position ahead of time (by the amount given
by the ASIO output latency, which can also be found in timeInfo). the position is
related to the first sample of the block.

    What I need to do is this: from within the gui, I need to be able to determine what
    sample number is actually outputting to the audio device at any given time, accurate
    to about 50ms or so (even with large buffers being used, such as 8192).

    Is this possible?


hmmm, there is the nanoSeconds member in the VstTimeInfo structure,
but this is not strictly defined so it can be host dependent if or not it
is usable or even provided. if the reference is known, you might attempt to determine
the system time of 'now' and subtract that from the block start.
charlie

----------------------------------------------------------------------
You are very right Jens, but …

This is exactly the trick point. Let say, the host passes “n” frames to plug-in which takes “t” seconds to be played. The host sends the blocks (events and/or samples) “t” seconds ahead of the playing position (for now I am not worry about stopped situation). The plug-in must process them in less than “t” seconds, and the host will play them exactly after this time. This is at least the case on my system, and if this is always true, I can use the time of the blockSize and deltaFrame as latency to sync with the host.

    Fredrik,

    I think you got this a bit wrong. deltaFrames is the offset, in samples,
    from the start of the current sample block.

    To be able to sync your midi output with the host you would need to know
    the actual time when the sample block is played by the driver.

    So, I think it's mission impossible (unless VstTimeInfo can be used in
    some cool way).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
You say that the host sends the blocks t seconds ahead of the playing
position.
The broblem is that you should never assume that t is constant. In some
cases it may be far from.
The host may send 4 blocks at once, nothing for a while, 4 blocks at
once, nothing, 3 blocks...
Blocks size in first process call may be 256, second may be 1024, 256,
1024, 2048...
Well, you get the point.

Only when ASIO is used you can be somewhat sure that the time may be
constant. :)

The perfect solution would be to have event buffers work like audio
buffers. So you would have inEvents and outEvents. This way the host
could schedule the events with sample accurate timing.

That is why I used n and t. It doesn’t matter n = ?, since my timing will be based on the block size and not a constant number. The only problem could be whether the first block is called exactly prior to its sampling time. I think it is called this way because of programming logic.
